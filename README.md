# RemoteStorageApp

- Project Description: -

We would like to take control of a shared folder under a remote system.

More specifically, we would like to be able to:

Browse the remote shared folder, including its sub-folders.

Rename a remote shared file or sub-folder.

Download a remote shared file.

Upload a local file to a specified path under the remote shared folder.

Delete a shared remote file.

- Known Bugs: -

Trying to delete a file immediately after uploading it does not work,

but reloading the page should fix the issue.

- Credits: -

The design of the website drew heavily from:

by criticalmediartstudio.

- Future Plans: -

Having the operations of the website be asynchronous.
